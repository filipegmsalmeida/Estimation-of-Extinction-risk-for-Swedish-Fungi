# Estimation-of-Extinction-risk-for-Swedish-Fungi

First, you can find data for fungal species in Sweden in the file alldata.csv. Each row represents one species, with environmental (e.g., temperature) and human-related features (e.g., human population density index). This data was retrieved using a custom Python library (Baggstr√∂m et al., in prep.). The AOO and EOO were also calculated, and the extinction risk category for each species (when available) was extracted from the Swedish Red List.

Second, a script is provided that presents a deep neural network structure. In this script, you can test different architectures and evaluate them using various metrics, such as balanced accuracy, to guide model selection. You have a variety of outputs available to help you identify the best-performing model.
